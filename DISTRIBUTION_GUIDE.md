# Distribution Guide - Hospital Outcomes Analyzer

## Current Setup vs Standalone Distribution

### ❌ Current Setup (Requires Installation)
Your current files require your colleague to:
- Install Python dependencies
- Run installation scripts
- Troubleshoot environment issues

### ✅ Standalone Distribution (Zero Installation)
The standalone package includes:
- Pre-installed Python environment
- All required libraries bundled
- Data file included
- One-click launcher

## Creating a Standalone Package

### Step 1: Create the Package
```bash
./create_standalone.sh
```

This creates a `Hospital-Analyzer-Standalone` folder with everything bundled.

### Step 2: Share with Colleague
1. **Zip the folder**: Right-click → "Compress"
2. **Send the zip file** via email/file sharing
3. **Colleague extracts** and double-clicks "Hospital Analyzer.command"

## What Your Colleague Receives
